Arthur Samuel described it as: “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” This is an older, informal definition.</p>
<p>Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”</p>
<p>Example: playing checkers.</p>
<p>E = the experience of playing many games of checkers</p>
<p>T = the task of playing checkers.</p>
<p>P = the probability that the program will win the next game.</p>
<p>In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:</p>
<p>Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.</p>
<h3 id="Model-Representation"><a href="#Model-Representation" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation"></a>Model Representation</h3><p>To establish notation for future use, we’ll use x^{(i)}x<br>(i)<br>  to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and y^{(i)}y<br>(i)<br>  to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). A pair (x^{(i)} , y^{(i)} )(x<br>(i)<br> ,y<br>(i)<br> ) is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples (x(i),y(i));i=1,…,m—is called a training set. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = ℝ.</p>
<p>To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a hypothesis. Seen pictorially, the process is therefore like this:</p>
<p>When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem.</p>
